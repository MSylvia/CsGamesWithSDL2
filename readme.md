C# Games with SDL2 library on .Net Core
=======================================

Jonathan's very small C# .Net Core library that covers SDL2.DLL 
and the SDL2-CS interop libraries with a more OO interface.

This is intended to support development of retro games, so
limited functionality is exposed.
